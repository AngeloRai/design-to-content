# Phase 2: AI Validation & Refinement

**Duration:** 40 minutes (3 tasks, 10-15 minutes each)
**Goal:** AI-powered validation and iterative component improvement
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 complete, generated components available

## Overview

Phase 2 adds AI-driven validation and refinement. AI compares generated components with original designs, identifies improvements, and iteratively refines until quality is sufficient.

## Task Sequence

Complete these simplified tasks in order:

### [Task 2.1: Multi-Agent AI Validation](./task-01-ai-validation.md)
**Time:** 15 minutes | **Difficulty:** Medium
- Implement supervisor-agent pattern for specialized validation
- AI agents handle visual, accessibility, and performance validation in parallel
- AI provides intelligent quality assessment and improvement suggestions

**Exit Criteria:** AI validates components and suggests improvements

---

### [Task 2.2: AI Component Refinement](./task-02-ai-refinement.md)
**Time:** 20 minutes | **Difficulty:** Medium
- AI iteratively improves components based on validation feedback
- AI refines code quality, styling, and accuracy
- AI determines when components meet quality standards

**Exit Criteria:** AI refines components until sufficient quality achieved

---

### [Task 2.3: Quality Assessment](./task-03-quality-assessment.md)
**Time:** 5 minutes | **Difficulty:** Easy
- AI generates final quality reports and documentation
- AI assesses production readiness
- AI provides usage guidelines and recommendations

**Exit Criteria:** Final quality assessment and documentation complete

## Success Metrics

By the end of Phase 2, you should have:

- ✅ Multi-agent AI validation with supervisor coordination
- ✅ Parallel processing of validation tasks for efficiency
- ✅ AI iteratively improves component quality using specialized agents
- ✅ AI determines when refinement is sufficient across all validation dimensions
- ✅ High-quality components validated by multiple AI specialists
