# Task 2.2: AI Component Refinement

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes
**Difficulty:** Medium

## Objective
Implement AI-driven iterative refinement that improves components based on validation feedback until quality standards are met.

## Tasks
- AI analyzes validation feedback and generates component improvements
- AI iteratively refines components through multiple passes
- AI determines when refinement is sufficient and should stop
- AI maintains code quality while improving visual accuracy

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ AI-Driven Refinement
- [ ] AI analyzes validation feedback to identify specific improvements
- [ ] AI generates improved component code based on feedback
- [ ] AI maintains component structure while fixing issues
- [ ] AI preserves functionality while improving visual accuracy

### ✅ Iterative Process
- [ ] AI can perform multiple refinement iterations
- [ ] AI tracks improvement progress across iterations
- [ ] AI adapts refinement strategy based on previous results
- [ ] AI avoids infinite loops or degrading quality

### ✅ Quality Management
- [ ] AI maintains code quality during refinement
- [ ] AI preserves TypeScript interfaces and props
- [ ] AI ensures components remain compilable and functional
- [ ] AI balances visual accuracy with code maintainability

### ✅ Stopping Criteria
- [ ] AI determines when components are good enough
- [ ] AI recognizes when further refinement isn't beneficial
- [ ] AI provides clear reasoning for stopping decisions
- [ ] AI handles cases where perfect accuracy isn't achievable

## Verification
```bash
# Test AI refinement
npm run test:refinement

# Expected: AI iteratively improves components until sufficient quality
```

## Notes
- Let AI make intelligent decisions about when to stop
- Focus on meaningful improvements over pixel perfection
- Ensure refinement process doesn't break component functionality
- AI should understand diminishing returns and practical limitations
