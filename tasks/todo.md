# Implementation Plan: Phase 0 Task 3 - Basic State & Workflow

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Centralized prompts system extracted from figma-processor
- ✅ Modern LangGraph patterns researched and documented
- ✅ **ISOLATED SYSTEM CREATED**: `design-to-code-system/` directory
- ✅ LangGraph dependencies installed and configured
- ✅ Modern TypeScript configuration for isolated development
- ✅ Modern state schema with Annotation.Root implemented and tested
- 🔄 Command-based workflow nodes in development

## Architectural Decision: Isolated System

**IMPORTANT**: Created `design-to-code-system/` as a completely isolated system to:
- Prevent conflicts with existing `figma-processor` and `nextjs-app` code
- Enable independent development and testing
- Provide clean separation of concerns
- Allow gradual migration from existing system

### ✅ Step 1: Setup Dependencies & Configuration (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Added @langchain/langgraph v0.4.9, @langchain/openai, zod dependencies
- ✅ Configured TypeScript for isolated development
- ✅ Created isolated project structure in `design-to-code-system/`

### ✅ Step 2: Create Modern State Schema (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Implemented Annotation.Root pattern with proper reducers
- ✅ Added comprehensive Zod schemas for validation
- ✅ Created state utilities and helper functions
- ✅ Comprehensive testing with 7 test cases passing

### ✅ Step 3: Basic Command-Based Workflow Nodes (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Analysis node with Command routing and mock AI integration
- ✅ Routing node with intelligent generation strategy decisions
- ✅ Generation nodes (atoms, molecules, mixed) with validation
- ✅ Validation node with quality assessment and scoring
- ✅ Terminal nodes (completion, revision, error) for all outcomes

### ✅ Step 4: Graph Construction & Testing (COMPLETED)
- ✅ StateGraph built with modern Command-based routing (9 nodes total)
- ✅ All nodes properly connected with appropriate endpoints
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 7 test scenarios ALL PASSING
- ✅ End-to-end workflow execution successful (3 components generated)
- ✅ Streaming workflow functionality implemented with real-time monitoring
- ✅ Error handling and state persistence verified
- ✅ Complete isolation from existing codebase achieved

## Potential Risks/Impacts
- **Risk**: New dependencies might conflict with existing code
  - **Mitigation**: Test in isolation, use exact version pinning
- **Risk**: TypeScript configuration changes could affect existing code
  - **Mitigation**: Only add new tsconfig for LangGraph, don't modify existing
- **Risk**: Complex state management could be hard to debug
  - **Mitigation**: Start simple, add logging, use mock data initially

## Step-by-Step Implementation Tasks

### ✅ Phase 0 - Foundation
1. [ ] **Setup**: Install LangGraph dependencies
2. [ ] **Config**: Create TypeScript configuration
3. [ ] **Schema**: Implement modern state schema with Annotation.Root
4. [ ] **Nodes**: Create basic Command-based nodes
5. [ ] **Graph**: Construct and compile StateGraph
6. [ ] **Test**: Execute with mock data and verify state flow

### ⏳ Phase 1 - AI Integration (After Phase 0 complete)
### ⏳ Phase 2 - Validation System (After Phase 1 complete)
### ⏳ Phase 3 - Library Management (After Phase 2 complete)

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR PHASE 0 - ALL COMPLETED!
- ✅ Graph compiles without errors
- ✅ Executes with mock data successfully (100% test pass rate)
- ✅ State flows correctly between nodes (6 phase transitions tracked)
- ✅ Command routing works as expected (dynamic node routing)
- ✅ Error handling prevents crashes (graceful error recovery)
- ✅ Code follows project conventions (CLAUDE.md principles applied)

## 🎯 PHASE 0 COMPLETION SUMMARY

**What was accomplished:**
1. **Complete isolation**: New system in `design-to-code-system/` with its own dependencies
2. **Modern LangGraph implementation**: Using latest patterns (Annotation.Root, Command routing)
3. **Comprehensive testing**: 7 test scenarios all passing with detailed validation
4. **End-to-end workflow**: Successfully processes input → analysis → routing → generation → validation → completion
5. **Proven architecture**: Ready for Phase 1 AI integration

**Key metrics from successful test run:**
- ✅ 3 components generated successfully
- ✅ 100% validation pass rate
- ✅ All 9 workflow nodes functioning
- ✅ Complete phase progression: init → analysis → routing → generation → validation → complete
- ✅ State persistence and error handling verified
- ✅ Cost tracking and token usage implemented

**Ready for Phase 1**: Real AI integration (GPT-4o Vision, structured outputs, production prompts)

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test each node in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test graph execution end-to-end
3. **Mock Data**: Use realistic but fake data initially
4. **Error Scenarios**: Test with invalid inputs
5. **State Validation**: Verify state transitions work correctly
