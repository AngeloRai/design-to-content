# JIRA-Style AI-Centric Tasks

## Phase 1: Core AI Pipeline (30 min total)

### Task 1.1: AI Visual Analysis (10 min)
**Story:** As a developer, I want AI to analyze Figma designs and extract component information so that I can generate appropriate React components.

**Tasks:**
- Implement AI analysis using OpenAI Vision API
- Parse design screenshots to identify components, variants, colors, spacing
- Return structured JSON output for pipeline consumption

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AI analyzes any Figma design without hardcoded assumptions
- Returns component types, variants, styling information
- Handles API failures gracefully with fallback data
- Works with different design systems and patterns

---

### Task 1.2: AI Component Generation (15 min)
**Story:** As a developer, I want AI to generate React components from design analysis so that I can have production-ready code.

**Tasks:**
- Implement AI-powered component generation
- Generate React components with TypeScript interfaces
- Save components to organized file structure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AI generates complete React components from analysis
- Includes appropriate props, variants, and accessibility
- Creates clean file structure with index exports
- Handles generation errors without stopping pipeline

---

### Task 1.3: Basic Pipeline Setup (5 min)
**Story:** As a developer, I want a basic LangGraph workflow so that I can orchestrate the AI analysis and generation process.

**Tasks:**
- Create simple LangGraph state schema
- Connect analysis and generation nodes
- Add basic error handling and logging

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Pipeline runs analysis then generation sequentially
- State passes data between nodes correctly
- Errors are captured and logged appropriately
- Can be tested end-to-end with sample data

---

## Phase 2: AI Validation & Refinement (40 min total)

### Task 2.1: AI Visual Validation (15 min)
**Story:** As a developer, I want AI to compare generated components with original designs so that I can assess quality and identify improvements.

**Tasks:**
- Implement AI-powered visual comparison
- Compare original Figma design with rendered component
- Generate quality assessment and improvement suggestions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AI compares images and provides intelligent feedback
- Identifies specific differences and their importance
- Suggests concrete improvements
- Works with any design style or component type

---

### Task 2.2: AI Component Refinement (20 min)
**Story:** As a developer, I want AI to iteratively improve components based on validation feedback so that I can achieve high-quality results.

**Tasks:**
- Implement AI-driven component improvement
- Iterate based on visual comparison feedback
- Stop when AI determines quality is sufficient

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AI refines components based on validation results
- Improves code quality, styling, and accuracy
- Decides when components are good enough
- Handles multiple refinement iterations

---

### Task 2.3: Quality Assessment (5 min)
**Story:** As a developer, I want AI to provide final quality reports so that I can understand the generated components' readiness.

**Tasks:**
- Generate AI-powered quality reports
- Assess production readiness
- Provide documentation and usage guidelines

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AI evaluates final component quality
- Generates comprehensive quality reports
- Provides usage documentation
- Gives production readiness assessment

---

## Phase 3: Production Integration (30 min total)

### Task 3.1: TypeScript Enhancement (15 min)
**Story:** As a developer, I want AI to enhance TypeScript definitions so that I have robust type safety.

**Tasks:**
- AI generates comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Creates utility types and helper functions
- Ensures type safety across all components

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Complete TypeScript interfaces for all components
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Proper type exports and documentation
- AI adapts types to actual component features

---

### Task 3.2: Production Build (10 min)
**Story:** As a developer, I want to package components for production so that I can deploy or distribute them.

**Tasks:**
- Create production build configuration
- Generate optimized component bundles
- Include necessary documentation and examples

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Components build successfully for production
- Optimized bundle sizes
- Complete documentation included
- Ready for npm publishing or direct usage

---

### Task 3.3: Validation & Deploy (5 min)
**Story:** As a developer, I want final validation before deployment so that I can ensure everything works correctly.

**Tasks:**
- Run comprehensive validation suite
- Verify build artifacts
- Generate final deployment package

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All tests pass successfully
- Build artifacts are valid and complete
- Deployment package is ready
- No critical issues identified

---

## Key Principles

- **AI-First:** AI makes all intelligent decisions, code handles orchestration
- **Generic:** Works with any Figma design without assumptions
- **Simple:** Focus on essential functionality, avoid over-engineering
- **Maintainable:** Clean interfaces and error handling
- **Flexible:** Adapts to different design systems and requirements
