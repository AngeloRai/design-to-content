# Task 0.1: Project Setup

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Objective
Set up the basic project structure, install essential dependencies, and configure environment variables for the AI-centric pipeline.

## Tasks
- Create clean project structure with essential folders only
- Install LangGraph, OpenAI, and minimal dependencies
- Configure environment variables for API keys
- Set up basic scripts and configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Project Structure
- [ ] Project directory created with clean folder structure
- [ ] `package.json` initialized with correct scripts
- [ ] Essential folders created: `src/`, `tests/`, `data/`
- [ ] `.gitignore` configured appropriately

### ✅ Dependencies
- [ ] LangGraph packages installed (`@langchain/langgraph`, `@langchain/core`)
- [ ] OpenAI SDK installed (`openai`)
- [ ] Essential utilities installed (file system, path handling)
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies

### ✅ Environment Configuration
- [ ] `.env.example` created with required variables
- [ ] Environment loading configured
- [ ] OpenAI API key variable set up
- [ ] Development vs production configuration

### ✅ Basic Scripts
- [ ] `npm start` - run the pipeline
- [ ] `npm test` - run verification tests
- [ ] `npm run verify` - health check
- [ ] All scripts execute without errors

## Verification
```bash
# Test project setup
npm install
npm run verify

# Expected: All dependencies installed, environment loaded, basic structure ready
```

## Notes
- Focus on essentials only - avoid over-engineering
- Keep dependencies minimal for faster setup
- Ensure API keys are secure and not committed to git
