# Task 0.2: AI Utilities

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes
**Difficulty:** Medium

## Objective
Create simple, reusable AI utility functions for OpenAI API interaction with proper error handling and response parsing.

## Tasks
- Create OpenAI client wrapper with configuration
- Add utility functions for common AI operations
- Implement response parsing and validation
- Add comprehensive error handling for API failures

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ AI Client Setup
- [ ] OpenAI client properly initialized with API key
- [ ] Configuration options for different models
- [ ] Connection testing function
- [ ] Graceful handling of missing API keys

### ✅ Core AI Functions
- [ ] `analyzeWithAI()` - for visual analysis tasks
- [ ] `generateWithAI()` - for code generation tasks
- [ ] `validateWithAI()` - for quality assessment tasks
- [ ] All functions use consistent interfaces

### ✅ Response Handling
- [ ] JSON parsing with fallback for malformed responses
- [ ] Structured error responses for failed operations
- [ ] Retry logic for transient API failures
- [ ] Response validation and cleaning

### ✅ Error Management
- [ ] Network error handling
- [ ] Rate limiting detection and handling
- [ ] API quota/billing error handling
- [ ] Meaningful error messages for debugging

## Verification
```bash
# Test AI utilities
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key npm test

# Expected: AI functions work, errors handled gracefully, fallbacks active
```

## Notes
- Keep AI functions simple and focused
- Prioritize error handling over advanced features
- Use consistent return formats for predictable parsing
- Add logging for debugging API interactions
