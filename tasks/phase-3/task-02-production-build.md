# Task 3.2: Production Build

**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Objective
Create optimized production build configuration and generate deployment-ready component bundles.

## Tasks
- Set up production build configuration
- Generate optimized component bundles
- Include documentation and usage examples
- Ensure all assets are properly packaged for distribution

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Build Configuration
- [ ] Production build configuration created and working
- [ ] Proper optimization settings (minification, tree-shaking)
- [ ] Source maps generated for debugging
- [ ] Bundle size analysis and reporting

### ✅ Component Packaging
- [ ] All components properly bundled for distribution
- [ ] TypeScript definitions included in build output
- [ ] Package.json with correct exports and entry points
- [ ] Dependencies properly declared

### ✅ Documentation Inclusion
- [ ] Usage examples included in build
- [ ] README files generated for component usage
- [ ] API documentation accessible
- [ ] Installation and setup instructions provided

### ✅ Quality Assurance
- [ ] Build artifacts validated and tested
- [ ] No broken imports or missing dependencies
- [ ] Compatible with common bundlers and frameworks
- [ ] Performance metrics meet standards

## Verification
```bash
# Test production build
npm run build:production

# Verify build output
npm run verify:build

# Expected: Optimized, ready-to-deploy component library
```

## Next.js Integration Notes

### Component Library Structure
Components will be built from the Next.js UI structure:
```
nextjs-app/ui/
├── elements/          # Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs)
├── components/        # Complex components (cards, modals)
├── modules/          # Page-level modules (navigation, forms)
└── index.ts          # Main export file
```

### Build Configuration
```typescript
// Next.js component build configuration
const buildConfig = {
  input: 'nextjs-app/ui',
  output: {
    dir: 'dist',
    format: ['esm', 'cjs'],
    preserveModules: true
  },
  external: ['react', 'react-dom', 'next'],
  plugins: [
    typescript({ declaration: true }),
    resolve({ extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx'] })
  ]
};
```

## Implementation Notes
- Build components from **nextjs-app/ui/** directory structure
- Preserve Next.js compatibility in output bundles
- Generate separate exports for elements, components, and modules
- Include Next.js-specific optimization hints
- Test build artifacts work with Next.js projects
