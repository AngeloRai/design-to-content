# Task 1.3: Complete Pipeline

**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Objective
Connect AI analysis and generation in a complete LangGraph workflow with proper error handling and logging.

## Tasks
- Connect analysis and generation nodes in LangGraph
- Add error handling and graceful failure recovery
- Implement basic logging and progress tracking
- Test complete pipeline with sample Figma input

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Workflow Integration
- [ ] LangGraph workflow connects analysis and generation
- [ ] State flows properly between nodes
- [ ] Conditional edges handle different scenarios
- [ ] Clean entry and exit points defined

### ✅ Error Handling
- [ ] API failures don't crash the pipeline
- [ ] Graceful degradation when AI calls fail
- [ ] Meaningful error messages for debugging
- [ ] Pipeline continues with fallback data when possible

### ✅ Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Progress tracking throughout pipeline execution
- [ ] Clear logging of AI operations and results
- [ ] Performance timing for optimization
- [ ] Success/failure metrics captured

### ✅ End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Complete pipeline works with sample Figma design
- [ ] Input validation and output verification
- [ ] Multiple design types tested successfully
- [ ] Pipeline performance is acceptable

## Verification
```bash
# Test complete pipeline
npm run test:pipeline

# Test with sample design
npm run demo

# Expected: Figma design → AI analysis → React components
```

## Notes
- Keep the pipeline simple and focused
- Prioritize reliability over advanced features
- Ensure pipeline can be extended in future phases
- Focus on getting the basic flow working correctly
