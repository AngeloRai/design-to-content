# Phase 1: Core AI Pipeline

**Duration:** 30 minutes (3 tasks, 10-15 minutes each)
**Goal:** Implement AI-powered analysis and component generation
**Prerequisites:** Phase 0 complete, OpenAI API key configured

## Overview

Phase 1 creates the core AI pipeline: Figma design analysis, AI-powered component generation, and basic file output. Everything is AI-driven with minimal hardcoded logic.

## Task Sequence

Complete these simplified tasks in order:

### [Task 1.1: AI Visual Analysis](./task-01-ai-analysis.md)
**Time:** 10 minutes | **Difficulty:** Easy
- Implement AI analysis of Figma design screenshots
- Extract components, variants, colors, and patterns
- Return structured data for generation

**Exit Criteria:** AI analyzes any design and returns component data

---

### [Task 1.2: AI Component Generation](./task-02-ai-generation.md)
**Time:** 15 minutes | **Difficulty:** Medium
- Generate React components using AI based on analysis
- Include TypeScript interfaces and proper structure
- Save components to organized file system

**Exit Criteria:** AI generates production-ready React components

---

### [Task 1.3: Complete Pipeline](./task-03-pipeline.md)
**Time:** 5 minutes | **Difficulty:** Easy
- Connect analysis and generation in LangGraph workflow
- Add error handling and logging
- Test end-to-end with sample Figma design

**Exit Criteria:** Complete pipeline works from Figma input to React output

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Ensure Phase 0 is complete
cd design-to-content/langgraph-pipeline/
npm run verify

# Start with Task 1.1
cd ../tasks/phase-1/
open task-01-figma-integration.md

# Follow each task sequentially
# Complete acceptance criteria before moving to next task
```

## Success Metrics

By the end of Phase 1, you should have:

- âœ… AI analyzes any Figma design without assumptions
- âœ… AI generates appropriate React components
- âœ… Complete workflow from design to code
- âœ… Works with different design systems and patterns
- âœ… Clean file output structure

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test complete pipeline
npm run test:pipeline

# Test with sample design
npm run demo

# Expected: Figma design â†’ AI analysis â†’ React components
```

## What Makes This AI-Centric

- **No hardcoded component types** - AI identifies what it sees
- **No fixed color palettes** - AI extracts actual colors used
- **No preset variants** - AI finds actual design variations
- **Adaptive to any design system** - works with corporate, personal, experimental designs
- **Quality decisions made by AI** - not rigid rules

## Next Steps

Once Phase 1 verification passes, proceed to [Phase 2: AI Validation & Refinement](../phase-2/README.md) for visual validation and iterative improvement.

## What's Next

Once Phase 1 parity verification passes:

1. **Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰** You've built a complete LangGraph system
2. **Begin Phase 2**: [Advanced Features & Playwright Integration](../phase-2/README.md)
3. **Develop with confidence**: Full feature parity achieved

**Phase 1 Complete â†’ Ready for Phase 2! ðŸš€**
