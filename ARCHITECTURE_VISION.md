# AI-Centric Architecture Vision

## Core Philosophy: AI-First, Structure-Enabled

Instead of deterministic rules, we leverage AI's capabilities to:

1. **Analyze actual Figma designs** and extract real patterns
2. **Make intelligent decisions** based on visual analysis
3. **Adapt to any design system** without hardcoded assumptions
4. **Provide structured outputs** for maintainability

## Key Architectural Shifts

### ❌ FROM: Deterministic Rule-Based
```javascript
// BAD: Hardcoded assumptions
const standardColors = ['primary', 'secondary', 'success', 'warning'];
if (element.type === 'button') {
  variants.push('solid', 'outline', 'ghost', 'link');
}
```

### ✅ TO: AI-Driven Analysis
```javascript
// GOOD: AI analyzes actual design
const aiAnalysisPrompt = `
Analyze this Figma component and identify:
1. What variants exist in the actual design
2. What naming patterns are used
3. What interaction states are present
4. Return structured JSON with your findings
`;

const variants = await analyzeWithAI(component, aiAnalysisPrompt);
```

## Simplified Component Architecture

### 1. Visual Analysis Node (AI-Driven)
```javascript
export const createVisualAnalysisNode = () => {
  return async (state) => {
    const analysis = await analyzeWithAI({
      image: state.screenshot,
      context: state.figmaData,
      prompt: `
        Analyze this design component:
        1. Identify component type (button, input, card, etc.)
        2. List all visual variants you can see
        3. Determine interaction capabilities
        4. Extract text content and labels
        5. Identify spacing and sizing patterns

        Return as structured JSON.
      `
    });

    return { visualAnalysis: analysis };
  };
};
```

### 2. Component Generation Node (AI-Driven)
```javascript
export const createComponentGenerationNode = () => {
  return async (state) => {
    const component = await generateWithAI({
      analysis: state.visualAnalysis,
      prompt: `
        Generate React component code based on this analysis.

        Requirements:
        - Use TypeScript
        - Follow React best practices
        - Include props based on visual variants
        - Make it flexible and reusable

        Return clean, production-ready code.
      `
    });

    return { generatedComponent: component };
  };
};
```

### 3. Variant Detection (AI-Driven)
```javascript
export const createVariantDetector = () => {
  return async (components, designSystem) => {
    const variants = await analyzeWithAI({
      components,
      designSystem,
      prompt: `
        Looking at these components from the same design system:
        1. What variant patterns do you see?
        2. What naming conventions are used?
        3. What are the actual variant options (not generic ones)?
        4. How do variants affect styling?

        Extract the real patterns from this specific design.
      `
    });

    return variants;
  };
};
```

## Benefits of AI-Centric Approach

### 🎯 **Adaptability**
- Works with any design system
- No hardcoded assumptions
- Learns from actual designs

### 🧠 **Intelligence**
- Understands context and relationships
- Makes nuanced decisions
- Handles edge cases naturally

### 📊 **Structured Output**
- AI provides clean, structured results
- Easy to process and maintain
- Consistent format across different designs

### 🚀 **Scalability**
- Single approach works for all design systems
- Less code to maintain
- More robust and flexible

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Replace deterministic functions** with AI analysis calls
2. **Use structured prompts** to ensure consistent output format
3. **Let AI decide** variants, patterns, and relationships
4. **Maintain clean interfaces** between AI decisions and code generation
5. **Add validation** to ensure AI outputs are usable

This approach maximizes AI capabilities while maintaining the structured, maintainable outputs you want.
